Since a lot of my project is done and stored on Infinity Free hosting, it's making less and less sense for me to upload my daily progress on here. However, I want my profile to reflect the amount of work I really do put in. So any day I do work with sensitive files, I will leave a note here describing my progress for the day. 
Edit: I am still uploading progress on here and using this as more of a note for days when I don't make enough progress to warrant uploading here or do it on more private things
